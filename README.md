A text editor that's going to be part of cpplox interpreter (https://github.com/HUNTINGHOUND/cpplox). The texteditor is essentially a copy of the texteditor that can be found here (https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/index.html). This is a temporary respository to get the basics down before merging with the interpreter.

## Note
This respository will no longer be maintained and updated as all changes to the text editor will be made on https://github.com/HUNTINGHOUND/cpplox.
